Alfi asked Roy to go for shopping with her. Witty Roy came up with a condition. He said, for each product of MRP

 (Maximum Retail Price) R, she'll have to pay minimum of all the prime factors of R and he himself will pay rest of the amount. Without giving it a second thought Alfi agreed.

Now they bought N number of products. You're to find how much money did Roy had to pay for each product.

Input:

First line will contain integer N, number of products they bought.

Next N lines each will contain R, MRP of each product.

Output:

Print single integer in a new line, the amount of money Roy had to pay for each product.

Constraints:

2<=N,R<=1000000

Warning: Large I/O. Be careful with certain languages.

Explanation
Test Case #1: Only 1 prime factor of 5 is 5 itself, so Alfi will pay all the money and hence Roy has to pay 0.

Test Case #2: Prime Factors of 10 are 2 and 5, minimum of these is 2, so Alfi pays 2 and hence Roy has to pay the rest, which is 8.
